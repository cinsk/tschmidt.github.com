blurb: With the release of Rails 3.1, a lot has changed. Migrations saw quite a few changes that I really like and I wanted to share them here. Migrations have always been one of my favorite parts of Rails because they make managing your database tables a breeze and with Rails 3.1 it gets even easier.

  <p>
    Migrations in Rails 3.1 has moved the #up and #down methods to instance methods
    instead of class methods. This just feels better to me when writing migrations.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class MyAwesomeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def up
      # some change you want to make goes here
    end
  
    def down
      # revert the change you made in the up action
    end
  end{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Then, the Rails team took it one step further. Since most migrations are
    just doing the reverse in the down action as what was done in the up action
    they have introduced the #change action. When defined in your migration
    this combines both the up and down actions into a single method call.
  </p>
  
  <p>I. Heart. This.</p>
  
  <p>
    It always felt like 90% of the migrations that I was writing didn't need
    a separate definition for the down action. I wanted Rails to just figure
    out that "if I'm creating a table in the up, then drop it in the down" or
    "if I'm adding a column then remove it" or "if I'm changing a column then
    change it back". Well, now that happens for us thanks to the new
    <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/migration/command_recorder.rb">ActiveRecord::Migration::CommandRecorder</a> class.
    I've added a few examples to show you how simple your migrations can
    now be.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight ruby linenos %}
  # Add/Drop a table
  class MyAwesomeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table(:users) do |t|
        t.string :first_name
        t.string :last_name
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
  
  # Add/Remove a table column
  class MyAwesomeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      add_column :users, :birthdate, :date
    end
  end
  
  # Rename a column in a table
  class MyAwesomeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      rename_column :users, :birthdate, :birthday
      # This one is a bit interesting because when the reverse is called
      # the arguments you specify are simply reversed. So this would be the "down"
      # action
      #
      #    rename_column :users, :birthday, :birthdate
    end
  end{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Obviously, not everything can be reversed. For example, how would you
    logically reverse removing a column? At first you might think "that's easy, 
    just call add_column on the down action". The only problem with that is
    when you call `remove_column' you don't specify the type for the column.
    That means when the `add_column' action is called it will fail. Not to worry,
    Rails will alert you if you have tried to do something it has deemed
    irreversible. An `IrreversibleMigration' exception will be raised.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is a list of the actions that are auto-magically reversed. The reverse
    action is given inside the parenthesis:
    
    <ul>
      <li>add_column (remove_column)</li>
      <li>add_index (remove_index)</li>
      <li>add_timestamps (remove_timestamps)</li>
      <li>create_table (drop_table)</li>
      <li>remove_timestamps (add_timestamps)</li>
      <li>rename_column</li>
      <li>rename_index</li>
      <li>rename_table</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another change that was made to keep in line with the new #change method
    is that when you create a migration from a constructive migration generator,
    the change method will be used in place of the up and down methods. Wondering
    what a "constructive migration generator" is? Here's and example:
  </p>
  
  {% highlight console %}
  #=> rails g migration AddFirstNameToUsers first_name:string{% endhighlight %}
  
  {% highlight ruby linenos %}
  # The following migration is created
  class AddFirstNameToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      add_column :users, :first_name, :string
    end
  end{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    And there you have it. Migrations in Rails 3.1 are even more awesome than
    they used to be. So get out there and try these techniques for yourself.
