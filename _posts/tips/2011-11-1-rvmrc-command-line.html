    The .rvmrc file tells RVM to switch to a particular Ruby version and/or gemset
    for a project or folder. When you cd into the project RVM will evaluate the
    .rvmrc file and automatically switch to the ruby/gemset specified.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating this file by hand is pretty simple but there's a shortcut. Since you
    are most likely on the command line when you create your Ruby project you can
    just type the following command:
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm --rvmrc --create ruby_version@gemset{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    You would just specify the Ruby version (and patch level if you'd like) and
    the name of the gemset you want to use. Let's say I have a project called
    best_thing_evar and I want to use Ruby 1.9.2 on this project. I would cd into
    the root of that project and type the following.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm --rvmrc --create 1.9.2@best_thing_evar{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    That's it. When you look at the files in the root folder of your project
    you will see a .rvmrc file.
  </p>
  
  <h2>But wait! There's more!</h2>
  
  <p>
    If you have a system or user .rvmrc file and you have the following in it&#8230;
  </p>
  
  {% highlight ruby %}
  rvm_install_on_use_flag=1 {% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    &#8230;RVM will automatically install the Ruby you specify if it is not installed
    instead of complaining about it not being on your system.
