    If you peruse the list of patterns that they have available (and at the time I wrote this
    there were 85) you may find one that looks familiar. No, it's not deja vu, I'm using one of
    their patterns on this very site. To get your pattern on just head over to
    <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Subtle Patterns</a> and look around.
