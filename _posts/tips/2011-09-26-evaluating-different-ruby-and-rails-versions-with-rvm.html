blurb: If you've ever had to test an application that you are building with different versions of Ruby or Rails then you know how frustrating it can be. <a href="http://beginrescueend.com" target="_blank">RVM</a> aims to erase that frustration by making it incredibly easy to install multiple versions on the same development machine.

    The first thing that you will need to do is install RVM. To do this open
    a terminal and enter in the following command (please note, you will need
    to make sure you have git installed):
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm){% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Once the install finishes you will be instructed on how you can update your
    .bash_profile file with a load path to the rvm executable. Once that is
    done and the file has been saved you can simply type the follwoing into your
    terminal window to reload your shell (you can also just close and re-open
    your terminal window):
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  source .bash_profile{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Great, now that we've gotten that out of the way it's super simple to install
    new Ruby versions. Say you want to install Ruby 1.9.2, all you need to do
    now is type:
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm install 1.9.2{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    To use an installed Ruby use the following (substitute the version you want):
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm use 1.9.2{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Wondering which Ruby versions are available for download?
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm list known{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Want to know which you already have installed?
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm list{% endhighlight %}
  
  <h2>What About Rails?</h2>
  
  <p>
    Now that you know how to install different Ruby versions we can talk about how
    you can have different Rails environments. Let's say we have installed
    Ruby 1.9.2 and we are currently using that version and we want to try out
    Rails 3.1 without messing with any of our Rails 2.x applications. To do this
    we need to create what RVM calls a gemset. This will create a separate 
    container where we install gems for a particular purpose.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm gemset create rails31{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    This will create a new gemset called "rails31". Now all we need to do is
    switch into that gemset:
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm gemset use rails31{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    This will place us into the rails31 gemset. You can see this by running
    <code>gem list</code> which will return a very short list of gems. Now we
    can install Rails 3.1. <strong>WARNING!!!</strong> When you install gems
    with RVM you will never want to use `sudo' when calling `gem install' while
    using one of the RVM installed rubies. If
    you do bad things will happen and kittens will die. The following command
    assumes that the Rails team hasn't released another version of Rails
    since 3.1.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  gem install rails{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Now we have Rails 3.1 installed in it's own contained gemset. We can now
    play around with it and not worry how installing this will effect our other
    applications running older Rails version. To get back out of this gemset
    simply call (assuming we still want to use the 1.9.2 Ruby version):
  </p>
  
  {% highlight sh %}
  rvm 1.9.2{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    There is a lot more information on RVM and how to use it including some
    pretty cool (and useful) advanced features. I highly recommend you look over
    the documentation on <a href="http://www.beginrescueend.com" target="_blank">RVMs website</a>.
