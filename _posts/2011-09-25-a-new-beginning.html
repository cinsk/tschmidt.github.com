blurb: Welcome to the new (and hopefully improved) SchmidtHappens. I have been thinking long and hard on how to move forward with my blog and while Tumblr was great for a while I kept hitting walls. I found myself spending less time writing and more time trying to figure out how I could do all the things that I wanted to do. Finally, I made the decision to leave Tumblr and try a new approach.
