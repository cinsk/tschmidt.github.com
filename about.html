    I am an enthusiastic Ruby and Rails developer who likes to dip his toes in the design pool
    every once-in-a-while. I am currently the Senior web developer for
    <a href="http://coleman.hccs.edu" target="_blank">HCC Coleman College</a> in Houston, TX.

    Besides programming I enjoy spending time with friends, reading, pretending to be an artist
    and just really enjoying life. What you are looking at is a public outpouring of all that
    jumbles around in my head. I hope you find something that piques your interest or even better
    helps you in some way.
